  ## Description
  This app helps set the foundation for any README file, which is next to necessary for any project in which you expect others to see. This project cuts down on development time in one area often overlooked, the README. A good README should be clear and concise and give whoever is reading it, every answer they might have without having to look at any code.

  ## Installation
  This app is designed only for backend use, which requires node.js to run from a local terminal, like Visual Studios built in terminal or git bash terminal. This app also requires the inquirer node module. To install any required modules, simply clone or download the code and in your terminal, run 'node install' and all the necessary files will be downloaded.

  ## Usage
  Simply follow the installation instructions, then run 'node index' within your terminal, and follow any on screen questions. The output will be saved to the file called 'generated-README.md'.

  ## Tests
  There shouldn't need to be any testing required, although if you would like to change the questions, you can just change the strings saved in the questions array at the top of index.js.

  ## Questions
  Any questions can be directed at the primary author via: <br>
